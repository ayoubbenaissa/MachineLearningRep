This contains a jupyter notebook file dealing with the famous "Iris" classification of flowers.
First, I began with imprting libraries (numpy, pandas, seaborn, sklearn...). 
Then, importing the dataset, and making some visualization which can help to extract important features and understand better the data set. 
Then, I used the GridSearchCV algorithm on the "RnadomForest" to find the best combination of parameters. 
I also, reused GridSearchCV to fiind the best algorithm from a set of ml algo (svm, linear regression...)
