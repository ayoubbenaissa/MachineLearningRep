this folder contains most commun steps that any datascientist will need.
These steps will be almost always used in machine learning with every model, and these steps are simply:
  *) Importing libraries that the datascientist will use through his work 
  *) Importing the dataset (that will be used to train the model but also to test it, since machine learning is all about data)
  *) In most cases the train data must be split into train data and dev-test data before dealing with the test set
   (this is Cross-validation)
   *) Sometimes the data contains alot of missing values that must be taken care of (Imputer), also sometimes dataset contains
   categorical data that the ML algo can't use so it must be transformed into numerical data (LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder)
