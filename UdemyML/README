this will contain all the files that I have made through to udemy course :
Machine Learning A-Z
the course helps you understand basics of machine learning algorithms,
and goes a little bit in theory but also it has very good practical exercices.
I have implemented different classical ML algorithms here (Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression,
SVM, Decision trees, Random Forest ...)
